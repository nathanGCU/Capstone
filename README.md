# Capstone

The Shlama: Colloquial Assyrian Language Tool is a language learning platform designed to help Assyrians in diaspora and others interested in learning the colloquial Assyrian language. The project addresses the lack of accessible resources for learning the Assyrian language and aims to foster cultural preservation and linguistic understanding.

Due to limited resources for learning the Assyrian language, this tool was developed as part of a capstone project to offer lessons, phonetics, and vocabulary for learners of all ages.

The features of the project include:
Lesson plans (such as alphabet, vocabulary, sentence structure)
Quizzes and interactive elements
WordPress-based framework
Mobile responsiveness
User registration and login
Forum for community interaction
Customizable user interface and lessons

Languages include:
HTML/CSS for structure and styling

PHP
JavaScript
